# Deployment Instructions for Digital Campsite Passport

## Overview
This document outlines the steps required to deploy the Digital Campsite Passport web application. The application consists of a client-side React application and a server-side Node.js application.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- A cloud service provider account (e.g., AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital-campsite-passport.git
cd digital-campsite-passport
```

### 2. Set Up the Server
1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install server dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the necessary environment variables, such as database connection strings and API keys.

4. Run database migrations (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### 3. Set Up the Client
1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   ```

2. Install client dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the client application for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Start the client application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### 4. Docker Deployment (Optional)
If you prefer to deploy using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine.

2. Build the Docker images:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. Start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

### 5. Accessing the Application
Once both the client and server are running, you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

### 6. Additional Configuration
- For production deployment, consider using a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) to serve the client application and handle API requests.
- Set up HTTPS for secure communication.
- Monitor application performance and logs for any issues.

## Conclusion
Following these steps will help you successfully deploy the Digital Campsite Passport application. For further assistance, refer to the project's README.md or contact the development team.
